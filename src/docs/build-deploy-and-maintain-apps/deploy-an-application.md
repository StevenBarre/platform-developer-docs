# Deploy an Application

You can read about how the OpenShift Container Platform handles deployments in [Red Hat's Documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/deployments/how_deployments_work.html) 

## Automation of CI/CD 

You can and should use automation to build, test and deploy your application. The platform services team provides [templates](./cicd-pipeline-templates-for-private-cloud-teams.md) to assist teams with using automation pipelines. [ArgoCD](./automation-and-resiliency/argo-cd-shared-instances.md) can also be integrated with automation pipelines.
