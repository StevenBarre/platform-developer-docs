# Training from the Platform Services team
Learning how to build in OpenShift can be hard. We’ve put together a number of resources to help.

## Openshift 101 and 201 <a name="openshift101201"></a>

Your first step in learning OpenShift is signing up for the [OpenShift 101 course](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/311464688267/). This course includes a theory 'workshop' component, and a practical series of 'lab exercises'. 

If the course fills up, email PlatformServicesTeam@gov.bc.ca - preference is given to recently onboarded teams. If you’re unable to attend a training session, we will soon be offering recordings. 

In September 2022 we will be launching an OpenShift 201 course to cover more advanced skills, building from the 101 course.
